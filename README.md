# REAPER Scripts

Here are some scripts I used when setting up a MIDI controller for [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) to control
[Playtime](https://www.helgoboss.org/projects/playtime/user-guide) (via [ReaLearn](https://www.helgoboss.org/projects/realearn/user-guide).)

The ReaLearn plugin has "import from clipboard" and "export to clipboard" features which make it easy to generate JSON using loops, etc.

My script generates some ReaLearn config that allows me to change the active PlayTime row by pressing number buttons on my keyboard (1 through 8), and then I can start recording by holding the "record" button and pressing a pad. I can also trigger playback of a track by pressing a pad.

ReaLearn is pretty amazing!
